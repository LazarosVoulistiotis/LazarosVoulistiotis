## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Lazaros, a dedicated BSc Computer Science student currently in my final year at Metropolitan College, in partnership with the University of East London. I have completed my first two years of the program and am now focused on the final year, which includes a research project (CN6000). My studies have given me a strong foundation in a variety of topics, from fundamental mathematics and software development to advanced programming and data structures. I have also gained practical experience in web and mobile application development and database systems. My academic work is complemented by professional skills honed over a decade of diverse experience, including leadership, problem-solving, and effective communication. Following my graduation, I aim to pursue a master's degree in AI, specializing in machine learning, and am open to collaborations.
